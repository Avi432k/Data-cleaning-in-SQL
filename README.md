# Data-cleaning-in-SQL
In these two projects, I cleaned data using MySQL. 

The first project, 'Data_cleaning.sql', is a dataset containing worldwide company layoff data. In this project, I removed duplicates, trimmed columns, standardised values, changed column formats, populated missing values, and removed unnecessary rows and columns.

The second project, 'housing_data_cleaning.sql', contains housing data. In this project, I changed the format of columns, populated missing data in columns, broke columns into separate indivdidual columns, changed values within a column for better readability, removed duplicates, and removed unused columns.
